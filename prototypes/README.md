This is just a toy program whose generated assembly code 
has been instrumented with my protections. This assembly
code can then be statically linked to create the
resulting tamper-proof executable. I haven't put the
compiled version of the code here because the addresses
keep changing with each recompilation and as such the 
source code along with the asm would need to be changed.
